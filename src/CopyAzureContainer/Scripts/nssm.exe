This file is a placeholder--it does nothing.
"sign.scripts.targets", which is imported by the project from ServerCommon, requires that "nssm.exe", "Functions.ps1", "PreDeploy.ps1", and "PostDeploy.ps1" all exist.
Therefore, this file must exist for the build to succeed.
This file isn't packed into the .nupkg built because the .nuspec doesn't include it.
